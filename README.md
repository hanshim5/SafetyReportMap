# 🦈 Safety Shark – CSULB Campus Incident Reporting Map

Safety Shark is a web app designed to help students at California State University, Long Beach stay informed about safety incidents on campus. By allowing users to report and view incident locations in real-time, the app promotes awareness, vigilance, and community-driven safety.

## 🎯 Inspiration

Many students share safety concerns or experiences on the CSULB subreddit—but those posts often get lost in the feed. We built Safety Shark to provide a centralized, accessible, and map-based way for students to track and report safety incidents in real time.

Our goal is to create a safer campus environment where students can stay alert and look out for one another.
